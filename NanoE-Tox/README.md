Katre Juganson et al. have published a paper in BJON about NanoE-Tox. This database
was composed by the Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology of NICPB (www.kbfi.ee).
The great news is that they released the content of this database under a
CC-BY 2.0 license as supplementary information of the article:

== Convertion to ENMRDF ==

This folder contains a Bioclipse script to convert the content from the database
into ENMRDF. The Excel spreadsheet was exported as a CSV file and because the column
headers contain newlines, these were manually removed, creating a CSV file without
any headers and just data.

That file is the input of the script.
